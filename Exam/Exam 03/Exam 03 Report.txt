Overall:  15 + 10 + 15 + 11 + 10 + 15 + 5 = 81

Part 1 (20 points)

Only state 2 in the original is a final state, so only the state based
on state 2 is a final state in the DFA.  And, from state 2 on input b,
you can follow the lambda link back to state 1, then stay in state 1.

15/20

Part 2 (10 points)

good 10/10

Part 3 (15 points)

good  15/15

Part 4 (15 points)

Presumably the lower c out of state 0 is meant to be a b.  But you
still accept aab, but that is not in the language.

11/15

Part 5 (15 points)

As the question said, show your work.   10/15

Part 6 (15 points)

good  15/15

Part 7 (10 points)

This is not a correct part tree.  Only nonterminals have child nodes
in a parse tree.
