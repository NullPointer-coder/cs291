Overall:  10 + 12 + 10 + 18 + 14 + 15 + 10 = 89

Part 1 (15 points)

The x in A(x) is a free variable and not related to the quantified x.
One or the other should be renamed.  Also your DNF isn't quite right.
It should pair A(x) with each of the three elements from the OR.

10/15

Part 2 (15 points)

The order here isn't quite right.  EI of can only instantiate a new
constant, but you instantiate d using UI in step 3, then reuse the
same d in EI in step 4.  Just switch the order of those two steps and
this is fine.

12/15

Part 3 (10 points)

good  10/10

Part 4 (20 points)

This question was messed up.  You successfully negated the wff and put
it in clausal form, but then you somehow did resolution with
non-matching predicates.  That isn't allowed.

18/20

Part 5 (15 points)

After you do the three AA steps, you can just use Composition to
combine them all together.  Generally this is okay.

14/15

Part 6 (15 points)

Okay.  Your second example is not first order logic, but I'll let that
slide.   15/15

Part 7 (10 points)

fine  10/10
